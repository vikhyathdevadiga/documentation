# ZeroFS Documentation

ZeroFS makes S3 storage feel like a real filesystem. It provides file-level access via NFS and 9P and block-level access via NBD. Fast enough to compile code on, with clients already built into your OS. No FUSE drivers, no kernel modules, just mount and go.

## Why ZeroFS? {{ anchor: false }}

Traditional filesystems are limited by local storage capacity and hardware constraints. ZeroFS breaks these limitations by turning S3 into a high-performance filesystem that's always encrypted, globally accessible, and infinitely scalable. Run databases, compile code, or even boot entire operating systems directly from S3 storage. {{ className: 'lead' }}
